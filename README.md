## 📌 Project Description
**DigitalSignatureStorage** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Algorand blockchain using **TypeScript smart contracts**.  
It allows users to **securely store and retrieve digital signatures** (for example, hashes of important documents) along with the signer’s wallet address.  

This ensures authenticity, immutability, and easy verification of digital assets without relying on centralized databases.

---

## 🚀 What it does
- Users can **store a digital signature** along with their wallet address.  
- Anyone can **retrieve the stored signature** and the associated signer address at any time.  
- Ensures **tamper-proof storage** by leveraging Algorand’s global state.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Store a **digital signature** on-chain  
- ✅ Save the **signer’s Algorand address**  
- ✅ Retrieve the **stored signature**  
- ✅ Retrieve the **signer’s address**  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly, lightweight smart contract (TypeScript)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Algorand Blockchain**
* **TypeScript**
* **Algorand Foundation SDK**

---

## 📚 How it Works

1. **User signs a document off-chain** (producing a hash/digital signature).
2. **Smart contract stores** the hash + signer’s wallet address.
3. **Anyone can query** the contract to verify the signature and signer.
